# Manipulation

## Introduction

This directory contains documents and source code related to data preprocessing operations for machine learning. During the development of machine learning models, data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the input data for machine learning algorithms.

## Contents

In this directory, you will find documents and source code related to various types of data preprocessing operations, including:

1. **Numerical Data Preprocessing:** Methods for normalization, scaling numerical data, and handling missing values.

2. **Image Data Preprocessing:** Image processing, resizing images to a fixed size, and normalizing image data.

3. **Text Data Preprocessing:** Text preprocessing, including tokenization, stop word removal, and text encoding.

4. **Time Data Preprocessing:** Methods for handling time-based data, extracting time information from timestamps, and standardizing time data.

## Usage
